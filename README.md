# Awesome HPC [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

High Performance Computing tools and resources for engineers and administrators.

[High Performance Computing (HPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) most generally refers to the practice of aggregating computing power in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out of a typical desktop computer or workstation in order to solve large problems in science, engineering, or business.
